# RunC

Run compiled language files as if they were shell scripts.

### Example

    $ cat main.c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
    	printf("Hello, World!\n");
    	return 0;
    }

    $ runc main.c
    Hello, World!

To debug with gdb:

    $ runc -d main.c

### How it works

RunC compiles the source file using some default compiler flags and invokes the built executable, passing on any other arguments. The executable is cached in `~/.runc/caches/<hash>`, where `hash` is a SHA-1 hash of the full file.

The default compilation command line is:

    clang -Wall -std=c99 <filename> -o ~/.runc/caches/<hash>

RunC is not limited to C programs. Use a hint comment to supply a different command line:

    /*! mcs /ref:SomeLib.dll */

    class Program
    {
    	public static void Main()
    	{
    		System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    	}
    }

This file would be compiled like so:

    mcs /ref:SomeLib.dll <filename> -o <filename> ~/.runc/caches/<hash>

This will work as long as the compiler accepts the `-o` option and the resulting executable can be ran directly by the shell.

It is also possible to supply only cflags:

    /*! -lcrypto -g */

Hints will be interpreted as solely cflags when the first non-whitespace character is a `-`. For this example, the resulting command would be:

    clang -Wall -std=c99 -lcrypto -g <filename> -o ~/.runc/caches/<hash>
